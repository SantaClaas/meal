# Tugboat

An app to make deployments easier.

## Why?

I tried [containrrr/watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) but couldn't get it to work (not because of watchtower). I knew the Rust [bollard crate](https://github.com/fussybeaver/bollard) from a [previous project](https://github.com/santaclaas/lettuce-soup) and decided that it would be faster to write my own single purpose service.
